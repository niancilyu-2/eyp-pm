# Readiness check (first run of `/pm:scout`)

Run this the first time `/pm:scout` starts in a workspace, or whenever `readiness.status`
is `not-run` or `blocked`. It should take under ten minutes. Run it before you plan to start so
problems surface early.

Report only one of three words, then the next action:

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Ready` | Everything works, including web search and Claude Design. |
| `Ready with fallback` | Fetch works but web search or Claude Design does not; the source ladder and the HTML path cover both. |
| `Blocked` | Something required is missing. State the single next action. |

## Checks, in order

1. **Plugin version.** Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and say
   "You are running the pm plugin version X." (Facilitators use this to spot stale installs.)
2. **Workspace folder.** Apply the folder checks in `workspace.md`. Create `.claude/skills/`,
   `outputs/prototype/`, `sources/`, and `.pm/`. Write `.pm/session.yaml` with
   `readiness.status: not-run` if it does not exist.
3. **Git.** Run `git --version`. Missing git is `Blocked`; the next action is to install
   Git for Windows or Xcode command-line tools, then rerun.
4. **Open a local HTML file.** Write a tiny file `outputs/readiness.html` (one heading that
   says "Your browser can open prototypes") and open it:
   `start outputs\readiness.html` on Windows, `open outputs/readiness.html` on macOS,
   `xdg-open` on Linux. Ask the PM whether a browser tab opened. Record
   `browser_test: confirmed | unconfirmed`. Unconfirmed is a warning, not a block;
   tell them they can double-click the file in their file manager later. Delete the file
   afterwards.
5. **Public web, two parts.** First, fetch one JSON feed you can verify, for example
   `https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=immich&tags=story&hitsPerPage=1`. If the
   fetch tool is unavailable or denied, record `web: unavailable`; this is `Blocked`
   unless an offline research pack has been provided. Second,
   run one web search (for example `immich backup`). If it works, record `search: ok`. If
   it returns a policy or permission error, record `search: unavailable` and put the error
   text in `notes` only. In the reply say one plain line ("Web search is switched off for
   your account; research still works") instead of showing the error. This is a warning,
   not a block, because the source ladder works on fetch alone. Ask the PM to
   forward the note to their administrator afterwards.
   Record which of the two worked under `readiness.feeds`.
   While doing this, tell the PM: "Claude Code will ask permission the first time
   it fetches a new website or runs a git command. Choosing the option that stops asking
   for this session will save you many clicks tomorrow."
6. **Claude Design.** Explain in one sentence: Claude Design is an optional way to generate
   the prototype visually; it needs a Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan, and on Enterprise
   an administrator must switch it on. Ask the PM to type `/design` on its own
   line and tell you what happened: a design tool started (`available`), an "unknown
   command" message appeared (`unavailable`), or they are unsure (`unknown`). Record it.
   `unavailable` or `unknown` means `Ready with fallback`, never `Blocked`.
7. **Pre-select a case (optional).** Show the five cases in one short table (name, persona,
   one-line mandate). Offer to pick one now so its repository can be downloaded today;
   they may change their mind on the day. If they pick, run the clone procedure in
   `workspace.md` and record `case.preselected: true`. If they decline, skip.
8. **Save.** Write `readiness` into `session.yaml` with `checked_at`, set
   `stage.current: setup`, and print the result line.

## After a successful check

Ask: "Stop here and continue later, or go straight into Discovery now?"

- **Stop:** set `readiness.stopped_after_setup: true`. Tell them: next time, open a
  terminal in this same folder, start a fresh `claude` session, and run `/pm:scout`. It
  will resume at case selection.
- **Continue:** proceed to case selection in `/pm:scout`.

## Rerunning readiness

If `/pm:scout` starts and `readiness.status` is `ready` or `ready-with-fallback`, do not
repeat the checks. Print "Readiness: <status> on <date>" and continue. Repeat only when the
PM asks or when a check obviously fails during the stage (for example, web fetch
now denied).
