# Setup

Do this before the workshop. It takes about 20 minutes. If you get stuck, note the step
number and ask the facilitator.

Claude Code is Claude running in a text window on your laptop. You type in plain English
and it replies in the same window. For the workshop you will type a few commands that
start with a slash, such as `/pm:scout`, and answer questions in ordinary sentences.

## 1. Account

You need a Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise account. If your company provides Claude,
the facilitator will tell you which sign-in to use.

## 2. Open a terminal

**Windows.** Press the Windows key, type `Terminal`, open it. The line should start
with `PS`.

**macOS.** Press Command and Space, type `Terminal`, press Enter.

Type a command at the prompt and press Enter to run it. Paste with Ctrl+V on Windows,
Command+V on macOS.

## 3. Install Claude Code

Paste one line and press Enter.

Windows:

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

Close the terminal, open a new one, and check:

```text
claude --version
```

You should see a version number.

## 4. Install Git

Check first:

```text
git --version
```

If you see a version number, skip to step 5. If not:

- **Windows.** Download Git for Windows from https://git-scm.com/downloads/win, run the
  installer, accept the defaults. Close and reopen the terminal.
- **macOS.** A dialog offers to install the tools. Click *Install*.

## 5. Sign in

Type `claude` and press Enter. Your browser opens. Sign in and return to the terminal.
When it asks whether you trust the folder, say yes. Type `/exit`.

## 6. Keys and commands

| To | Do |
|---|---|
| Send | Enter |
| New line without sending | Shift+Enter, or `\` then Enter |
| See available commands | type `/` |
| Stop Claude mid-reply | Escape |
| Clear the conversation | `/clear` |
| Quit | `/exit` |
| Reuse an earlier message | up arrow |
| Answer a multiple-choice question | arrow keys and Enter, or type your own answer |

Claude asks permission the first time it fetches a website, runs Git, or writes a file.
Pick the option that stops asking for the session.

Leave Shift+Tab alone. It changes permission modes.

## 7. Workshop folder and plugin

1. Create an empty folder called `pm-workshop` on your Desktop.
2. Open a terminal in it. Windows: right-click the folder, *Open in Terminal*. macOS:
   right-click the folder, *New Terminal at Folder*.
3. Type `claude`. Say yes to trusting the folder.
4. Type these two lines, one at a time:

   ```text
   /plugin marketplace add niancilyu-2/eyp-pm
   /plugin install pm@eyp-pm
   ```

5. Type `/` and confirm `/pm:scout` is in the list.
6. Type `/pm:scout`. It runs a readiness check and ends with `Ready`, `Ready with
   fallback`, or `Blocked`. For `Blocked`, do the action it prints and run `/pm:scout`
   again.
7. When asked, choose *stop after setup*.

## Checklist

- [ ] `claude --version` prints a version
- [ ] `git --version` prints a version
- [ ] `claude` starts without asking you to sign in
- [ ] `/pm:scout` reported `Ready` or `Ready with fallback`

## On the day

Open a terminal in `pm-workshop`, type `claude`, then:

| Stage | Type |
|---|---|
| Discovery | `/pm:scout` |
| | `/clear` |
| Prototype | `/pm:prototype` |
| | `/clear` |
| PRD | `/pm:prd` |
| | `/clear` |
| Capstone | `/pm:create-skill` |

Every reply ends with a status line such as `Scout · step 5/10 · fetches 6/16 · 14 min`.

## Problems

| You see | Do |
|---|---|
| `claude` not recognized | Close the terminal, open a new one. If it persists, rerun step 3 |
| `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator` | You are in PowerShell. Use the Windows line in step 3 |
| `'irm' is not recognized` | You are in the old Command Prompt. Open *Terminal* instead |
| Browser sign-in does not complete | Copy the link from the terminal into your browser. On a company laptop, check whether a VPN blocks claude.ai |
| Sign-in says your plan does not include Claude Code | Wrong account. Type `/logout`, then sign in with the workshop account |
| `/pm:` commands missing | `/plugin marketplace update eyp-pm`, then `/plugin install pm@eyp-pm` |
| Git missing | Step 4, then reopen the terminal and run `/pm:scout` |
| Path-too-long error on Windows | `git config --global core.longpaths true`, then `/pm:scout` |
| Web search policy error | Ignore it. Send the error text to whoever manages your Claude account |
| Screen looks stuck | Escape. If nothing changes, `/exit`, start `claude` again, rerun the stage command |
